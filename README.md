## Acknowledgments & Learning Process

This project was developed as part of an assignment, and my main goal was to better understand both Boids (flocking) behavior and the basics of developing in Unreal Engine. Throughout the process, I used several resources to guide my learning:

---

### **Boids Concept & Tutorials**

- I followed an online tutorial that explained Craig Reynolds’ Boids model and demonstrated how the three main rules—**Separation**, **Alignment**, and **Cohesion**—can be implemented in code.
- The tutorial helped me understand the math and logic behind flocking simulations.

### **Unreal Engine Learning**

Since I am still learning how to develop in Unreal Engine, I referenced beginner guides and tutorials to understand:

- how to set up actors and components  
- how to script behaviors using Blueprints and/or C++  
- how to organize a small Unreal project  

This project served as a hands-on way to become more familiar with Unreal workflow, scene setup, debugging, and iteration.

### **AI Assistance**

I used AI tools to help clarify certain topics or fix small issues, such as:

- improving the structure of functions  
- solving bugs or unexpected behavior  

AI was used as a learning aid, not for generating the full project.
